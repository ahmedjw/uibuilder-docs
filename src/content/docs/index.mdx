<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Drag-and-Drop Canvas" icon="pencil">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Extensible Components" icon="puzzle">
    Define custom components with `.catalogue.tsx` files alongside your code. Use Zod schemas for type-safe props and the editor auto-generates the properties panel.

  <Card title="16 Built-in Primitives" icon="setting">
    Ships with essential layout, typography, action, and form components out of the box. Everything you need to build any page.
  </Card>
