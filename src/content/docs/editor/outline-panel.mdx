title: Outline Panel
description: Navigating the component tree with the outline panel
---

The outline panel shows your component tree as a collapsible hierarchy, making it easy to navigate and select deeply nested components.

## Features

- **Tree view** — shows parent/child relationships
- **Click to select** — clicking a node selects it on the canvas and in the properties panel
- **Collapse/expand** — toggle container nodes to focus on specific areas
- **Component type icons** — each component type has a recognizable icon
- **Visual hierarchy** — indentation shows nesting depth

## Tree Structure

The outline mirrors the document structure:

```
Section
├── Heading ("Welcome")
├── Grid (3 columns)
│   ├── Container
│   │   └── Text ("Feature 1")
│   ├── Container
│   │   └── Text ("Feature 2")
│   └── Container
│       └── Text ("Feature 3")
└── Button ("Get Started")
```

## Interaction

- **Single click** — selects the component (scrolls canvas to it)
- **Expand/collapse** — click the toggle arrow next to containers
- **Selection sync** — selecting on canvas highlights in outline, and vice versa

## When to Use the Outline

The outline is especially useful when:

- Components overlap or are visually stacked
- You need to select a container (instead of its children)
- The component tree is deeply nested
- You want to understand the page structure at a glance
