import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The properties panel appears on the right side of the editor when a component is selected. It auto-generates form fields from the component's Zod schema.

## Field Types

| Zod Type | Rendered Field |
|----------|---------------|
| `z.string()` | Text input |
| `z.number()` | Number input with increment/decrement |
| `z.boolean()` | Toggle switch |
| `z.enum([...])` | Dropdown select |

## Field Labels

Field labels come from two sources (in priority order):

1. **`.describe()`** on the Zod field — e.g. `z.string().describe('Button text')`
2. **Field name** — e.g. `backgroundColor` becomes "backgroundColor"

## Common Props

Below the component-specific fields, you'll find collapsible groups for common props:

### Visual

Border radius, width, color, style, opacity, and box shadow.

### Sizing

Width, height, min/max width, min/max height overrides.

These are added automatically unless the component sets `commonProps: false`.

## Style Overrides Panel

At the bottom of the properties panel, the **Style Overrides** section lets you add arbitrary CSS properties as key-value pairs. These are merged into the component's inline styles.

## Data Binding Toggle

When [page state](/editor/data-binding/) is defined, each field shows a small **link icon** next to its label. Clicking it toggles between a static value input and a `$path` binding input. In binding mode, you can pick a path from the state model — the component displays the resolved value on the canvas in real-time.

<Aside type="tip">
Grid layout fields (Column Span, Row Span, etc.) do not support binding — they are internal editor props.
</Aside>

See the [Data Binding](/editor/data-binding/) page for full details.

## Inline Editing

Some components support **double-click to edit** directly on the canvas. For example, double-clicking a Heading or Text component enters inline editing mode, letting you type directly without using the properties panel.
