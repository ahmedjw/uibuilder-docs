title: What is UIBuilder?
description: Overview of the @coralstack/uibuilder library
---

**UIBuilder** is a visual drag-and-drop page editor that you install as a dev dependency in your React project — just like Storybook. It lets you (and your team) build pages by dragging components onto a canvas, configuring their props, and exporting the result as JSON.

## The Problem

Building page editors from scratch is hard:

- Drag-and-drop, selection, resize, undo/redo — all complex UI interactions
- Properties panels need to be generated from component schemas
- Preview and export require a rendering pipeline
- Every team ends up rebuilding the same editor scaffolding

## The Solution

UIBuilder gives you a complete, production-ready page editor out of the box:

```bash
npm install @coralstack/uibuilder --save-dev
npx uibuilder
```

That's it. Your editor is running with 16 built-in components ready to use.

## How It Works

1. **Install** the library as a dev dependency
2. **Define** your custom components with `.catalogue.tsx` files
3. **Configure** via `.uibuilder/config.ts`
4. **Run** `npx uibuilder` to launch the editor
5. **Export** your designs as JSON for production use

## Key Features

- **Drag-and-drop canvas** with real-time rendering
- **Properties panel** auto-generated from Zod schemas
- **Outline tree** for navigating complex component hierarchies
- **Undo/redo** with full history
- **Preview mode** powered by `@json-render/react`
- **AI chat** for generating component subtrees
- **16 built-in primitives** — layout, typography, actions, and forms
- **Extensible** — add any React component via `.catalogue.tsx` files
- **Export** to flat JSON spec format
